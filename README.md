# **One-Dimensional Quantum Droplet Model**

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/mateuszk098/quantum_droplet_model)

"_**We investigate a one-dimensional, strongly-interacting Bose system with an additional non-local dipolar term. Such a system offers a new form of ultra dilute state of matter – quantum droplet. This new quantum state may arise when in an ultracold system, one has two types of interactions with different nature – attractive and repulsive. There may occur a situation when the mean-field terms describing the competing forces are close to zero, and the significant role plays quantum corrections. The formation of a quantum droplet is possible in both, Bose-Bose mixtures, as predicted by D. Petrov, and in one-component BEC systems, as discovered by T. Pfau’s group.**_"

## **Destination of this Mini-Software**

_**The source code contained in this repository allows us to model the thermodynamic properties of a one-dimensional quantum droplet. We use the complete quantum well problem and its energy spectrum as the model. That spectrum enables us to simulate the quantum droplet excitation spectrum.**_
